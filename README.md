# Research Methodology

A project of Research Methodology, our purpose for this project is to investigates how academic, socioeconomic, and psychological factors influence changes in student learning performance, measured through the difference between midterm and final exam scores. The study applies a data-driven education framework using machine learning to uncover hidden patterns beyond traditional statistical methods.

Key contributions include:

- Constructed a predictive classification target based on score improvement or decline and performed exploratory data analysis and statistical testing (Pearson correlation, Chi-square, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis)

- Developed and compared multiple machine learning models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and CatBoost

- Addressed class imbalance using resampling techniques and feature scaling

- Achieved predictive performance with F1-scores ranging from 60% to 71%

- Applied SHAP interpretability analysis to identify dominant influencing features

- Main findings highlight that attendance and study duration are the strongest positive drivers of academic improvement, while logistical and social factors such as distance from campus and peer influence can negatively impact performance.

This project supports strategic recommendations for improving higher education outcomes through data-driven policy and learning analytics.
